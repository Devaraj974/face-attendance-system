## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/attendance-system.git
cd attendance-system
```

### 2. Add Student Images

- Save face images of each student in the `images/` folder.
- Use clear, front-facing images.

### 3. Update the Code

Inside `attendance_system.py`:

- Replace `"USER_NAME"` with actual student names.
- Replace `"IMAGE_PATH"` with the image paths (e.g., `"images/john.jpg"`).
- Replace `"USERMAIL@gmail.com"` with student emails.
- Set your email and app password (Gmail recommended for easier SMTP):

```python
sender_email = "youremail@gmail.com"
sender_password = "your-app-password"
```

### 4. Run the Program

```bash
python attendance_system.py
```

## 🖥 Controls

- Press **`d`** to display current attendance status in the console.
- Press **`q`** to quit and send absent alerts via email.

---

## 📊 Attendance Output

- Attendance is logged in `attendance.xlsx`.
- Each entry includes:
  - Student Name
  - Date
  - Status (Present/Absent)
  - Time of recognition

---

## 🔐 Email Alert Notes

- You must enable **less secure app access** or **App Passwords** in your Gmail account to use SMTP.
- Consider using an environment variable or `.env` file for email credentials in production.
